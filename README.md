Mentor: Isita Talukdar

This project seeks to predict breast cancer mortality with AI and ML algorithms on the Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer)

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented via sci-kit learn on a dataset of clinical information about breast cancer patients. The models were trained to predict mortality based on 6 variables: Tumor size, A Stage, Grade, Differentiation, Race, Status

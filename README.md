This project seeks to predict breast cancer mortality with AI and ML algorithms on the Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer)

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented via sci-kit learn on a dataset of clinical information about breast cancer patients. The models were trained to predict mortality based on 6 variables: Tumor size, A Stage, Grade, Differentiation, Race, Status

Overall, Logistic Regression performed best with a prediction accuracy of 84.8%, proving that ML can be used to predict breast cancer. Feature Importance analysis suggests that Tumor size and differentiation are the most crucial factors for predicting breast cancer survivability.
